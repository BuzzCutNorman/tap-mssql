# tap-mssql

`tap-mssql` is a Singer tap for mssql. !!! Warning !!! work in progress. It works ok üòê for full loads.
<br>It works maybe ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for Incremntal loads.

Built with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

### Whats New üõ≥Ô∏èüéâ
**2023-08-07 Fix:**  The installation issue with `pymssql` has been fixed by making `pymssql` 2.2.7 required

**2023-07-17 Upgraded to Meltano Singer-SDK 0.30.0:** 

**2023-06-14 Enhancement:**  The behavior of when a new mssqlConnector class is generated has been changed.  When the Tap discovers the database and also initializes Streams a Tap level connector is generated and passed on to Streams.  This mean instead of a database session per Stream there is a smaller pool of session being utilized over and over. You can use sp_who to see how may sessions are active.  I couldn't have added this without the SQLConnector refactoring work @qbatten did in SDK 0.20.0.  The inspiration for this feature came from comments made by @kgpayne. So a big Thanks üôè to both of them.

**2023-05-03 Incremental Replication:**  Equipped with the Singer-SDK documentation on how to implement Incremental Replication and davert0 issue filled with great details I headed off on a coding adventure.  There were twists, turns, and backtracking but in the end you can now setup Incremental Replication and it might work.  If you are using Meltano here is the documentation to follow to setup [Key-based Incremental Replication ](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#key-based-incremental-replication) and manage [Incremental Replication State](https://docs.meltano.com/guide/integration#incremental-replication-state). Skim over the documentation and head off on you own Incremental Replication adventure.

**2023-04-26 New HD JSON Schema Types:**  XML, IMAGE, BINARY, and VARBINARY types have been give definitions.  This is Thanksüôè to Singer-SDK 0.24.0 which allows for JSON Schema `contentMediaType` and `contentEncoding`.  Currently all binary data types are Base64 encoded before being sent to a tartget. The buzzcutnorman `target-mssql` and `target-postgres` are both able to translate them back into SQL data types. 

**2023-02-22 Batch Message Can Handle More Data Types:** You use batch message when a table contains DECIMAL or NUMERIC columns. Plus better batch message support for TIME, DATE, and DATETIME columns.

**2023-02-08 Higher Defined(HD) JSON Schema types:**  This is my interpretation of how to define MS SQL data types using the JSON Schema.  You can give it a try by setting `hd_jsonschema_types` to `True` in your `config.json` or `meltano.yml`.  The buzzcutnorman `target-mssql` and `target-postgres` are both able to translate them back into SQL data types.

Developer TODO: Update the below as needed to correctly describe the install procedure. For instance, if you do not have a PyPi repo, or if you want users to directly install from your git repo, you can modify this step as appropriate.
-->
## Installation

### Prerequisites
You will need to install the SQL Server Native Driver or ODBC Driver for SQL Server if you plan  to use the `driver_type` of `pyodbc`. These drivers are not needed when opting to use `pymssql`.

[Installing Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/windows/system-requirements-installation-and-driver-files?view=sql-server-ver16#installing-microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server)
<!--
Install from PyPi:

```bash
pipx install tap-mssql
```
-->
### Install from GitHub:

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/BuzzCutNorman/tap-mssql.git
```

### Meltano CLI

You can find this tap at [Meltano Hub](https://hub.meltano.com).  Which makes installation a snap.

Add the tap-stackoverflow-sampledata extractor to your project using meltano add :
```bash
meltano add extractor tap-mssql --variant buzzcutnorman
```

## Configuration

The simplest way to configure tap-mssql is to use the Meltano interactive configuration.

```bash
meltano config tap-mssql set --interactive
```

You can quickly set configuration options 1 - 7 this way: 
1. **dialect:** The Dialect of SQLAlchemy
2. **driver_type:** The Python Driver you will be using to connect to the SQL server
3. **host:** The FQDN of the Host serving out the SQL Instance
4. **port:** The port on which SQL awaiting connection
5. **user:** The User Account who has been granted access to the SQL Server
6. **password:** The Password for the User account
7. **database:** The Default database for this connection

**WARNING:** Do not attempt setting any other configuration options via interactive.  Doing so has lead to incomplete configurations that fail when the tap is run.

Options 8 - 15 can be setup via `meltano config tap-mssql set`.  Examples for the most commonly needed configurations options are given below.

When using `pyodbc` `sqlalchemy_url_query.driver` passes SQLAlchemny the installed ODBC driver. 
```bash
meltano config tap-mssql set sqlalchemy_url_query.driver "ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server"
```

When using `pyodbc` `sqlalchemy_url_query.TrustServerCertificate` let SQLAlchemy know whether to trust server signed certificates when connecting to SQL Server.
```bash
meltano config tap-mssql set sqlalchemy_url_query.TrustServerCertificate yes
```

The `pyodbc` driver has added support for a ‚Äúfast executemany‚Äù mode of execution which greatly reduces round trips.  You can trun the option on or off by setting `sqlalchemy_eng_params.fast_executemany` to `"True"` or `"False"`
```bash
meltano config tap-mssql set sqlalchemy_eng_params.fast_executemany "True"
```
### Accepted Config Options

### Configure using environment variables

This Singer tap will automatically import any environment variables within the working directory's
`.env` if the `--config=ENV` is provided, such that config values will be considered if a matching
environment variable is set either in the terminal context or in the `.env` file.
<!--
### Source Authentication and Authorization


Developer TODO: If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.
-->

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-mssql` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

<!--
### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-mssql --version
tap-mssql --help
tap-mssql --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

Follow these instructions to contribute to this project.

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_mssql/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-mssql` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-mssql --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

<!--
Developer TODO:
Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any "TODO" items listed in
the file.
-->
<!--
Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-mssql
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-mssql --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-mssql target-jsonl
```
-->
